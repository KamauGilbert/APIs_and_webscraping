### README Section: Communicating with APIs

#### What Are APIs?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are integral to modern software development as they enable the integration of different services and facilitate data sharing between applications.

#### Various Types of APIs

1. **Web APIs**: These are APIs accessed over the web using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. Examples include RESTful APIs and SOAP APIs.
2. **Library/Framework APIs**: These are APIs provided by software libraries or frameworks to facilitate specific functionalities within an application.
3. **Operating System APIs**: These allow applications to interact with the operating system, accessing hardware resources and system services.
4. **Database APIs**: These enable communication between an application and a database management system, allowing for data querying and manipulation.
5. **Remote APIs**: These are designed to interact with components outside the local environment, often over a network.

#### Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to practice using APIs to retrieve and manipulate data from external sources. By working on this project, I aimed to understand the process of connecting to an API, making requests, and parsing responses. The practical application involved working with a specific API, whose documentation is found here: https://github.com/swar/nba_api to fetch data and perform certain tasks programmatically.

#### Skills Gained

1. **Understanding API Documentation**: Learned to read and understand the API documentation to know how to make requests and handle responses.
2. **Making API Requests**: Gained proficiency in using Python libraries such as `requests` to make GET, POST, and other HTTP requests to APIs.
3. **Handling API Responses**: Learned to parse JSON and XML responses to extract relevant data.
4. **Data Processing**: Improved skills in processing and manipulating data retrieved from APIs for further analysis or storage.

#### How It Can Be Useful

This project serves as a foundational exercise for any software development involving API integrations. The skills and knowledge gained can be applied to:
- Building applications that require data from external sources, such as weather data, stock prices, or social media feeds.
- Automating tasks by interacting with various web services.
- Enhancing existing applications by integrating additional functionalities through third-party APIs.
- Preparing for more advanced projects involving microservices architecture where APIs play a crucial role in communication between services.

  # Web Scraping

## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the content of a web page and parsing it to retrieve specific information. Web scraping can be used for various purposes, such as data analysis, price monitoring, content aggregation, and more.

## Project Details

### URL Scraped

The data was scraped from the following URL:
- https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29

### Steps Performed

1. **Data Extraction**: Used `pandas` to read HTML tables from the specified URL.
2. **Data Processing**: Identified the column containing GDP values and converted these values from millions of USD to billions of USD, rounding to two decimal places.
3. **Data Storage**: Saved the processed data into a CSV file for further use.

## What I Learned

1. **Web Scraping Techniques**: I learned how to use the `pandas` library to scrape data from HTML tables on web pages.
2. **Data Processing**: I improved my skills in data cleaning and transformation, including handling string values and performing arithmetic operations on them.
3. **Automation of Data Collection**: This project taught me how to automate the process of data collection and storage for further analysis.

## Utilization of Skills

The skills I acquired through this project can be applied in several ways:

1. **Data Analysis**: Automating the collection of up-to-date data from the web for analysis and decision-making.
2. **Price Monitoring**: Scraping price data from e-commerce sites to monitor and compare product prices.
3. **Content Aggregation**: Aggregating data from multiple sources to create comprehensive datasets for research or business intelligence.
4. **Machine Learning**: Collecting large datasets for training machine learning models.

## Future Improvements

- **Dynamic Scraping**: Incorporate techniques for scraping data from dynamically loaded content using tools like Selenium.
- **Data Storage**: Explore different data storage options such as databases for more efficient data management.

## Conclusion

This web scraping project provided valuable insights into the process of extracting and processing data from the web. The skills learned will be highly beneficial for various applications in data analysis, business intelligence, and beyond.
